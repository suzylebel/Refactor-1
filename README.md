Name: 

Horiseon Website Refactor

Description:

In this refactor, the client reuqested the code have better HTML semantics. Without changing the physical appearance of the website, I changed elements and added tags to sections that met ARIA guidelines to make the HTML site more accessible to people with disabilities. 

Installation:
Open from github. Deploy in a default browser and inspect the code in chrome. 

Usage:
Creating <alt> tags with images allowed for webiste visitors with a dissability to understand the naviagtion and path of the site. I also fixed <div> and created <section> and a <nav> bar. Creating in <nav> element required me to change the CSS file as well so the was the only change to that file.

Project Status: 
I beleive I have completed the required coding fixes for our client to have better HTMl semantics. The code runs smoothly and the internal code has been cleaned up.
